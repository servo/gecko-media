# Gecko Media Rust Crate

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/servo/gecko-media.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/servo/gecko-media)

Firefox's Media stack in a Rust crate.

Build with `cargo build`.

Run tests with `cargo test`.

A minimalistic player is also available:
   ```
   $ cd examples
   $ cargo run --bin test-player -- /path/to/some/audio-file.ogg
   ```

## Procedure to update the imported code from Gecko

1. A mozilla-central Gecko build is required. Optimizations and debug should be enabled. Example `mozconfig` file:
    ```
    ac_add_options --enable-optimize 
    ac_add_options --enable-debug 
    ```
    
2. The import script has to be executed from the gecko-media directory:
    ```
    $ cd gecko-media
    $ python3 import.py /path/to/mozilla-central gecko/
    ```

   The `gecko-media/gecko/src` and `gecko-media/gecko/include` directories
   content will be removed and the source and header files declared in
   `gecko-media/data/*.json` will be copied back to those two directories.

3. The import script will create a subfolder inside `glue_diffs/` named with the
   upstream revision number you are updating to (i.e.
   glue_diffs/392049:f41930a869a8/). Inside this subfolder you may find a series
   of diff files. You need to apply these patches manually to the code inside
   `gecko-media/gecko/glue`. Some context about why this is needed can be found
   in this [issue](https://github.com/servo/gecko-media/issues/79).

4. Fix potential build errors!
